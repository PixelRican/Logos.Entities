## Overview

Monophyll.Entities is a simple and efficient Entity Component System for game development using the
C# programming language. The library is still under development, so stay tuned for changes!

## Folder Layout

The library's contents is organized into several folders:
* See Source for the library's source code.
* See Tests for the library's unit tests.

## Documentation

Documentation is available via XML comments within the source code. It may be a little rough around
the edges, but you should be able to deduce what the code does from reading it. However, I plan on
improving the docs while I continue working on the library.

## License

Monophyll.Entities is released under the MIT License. See LICENSE for details.
